## 3. Technology Spotlight

This project is built upon a modern, robust, and widely-adopted technology stack, chosen for its scalability, maintainability, and vibrant developer ecosystem. This combination ensures high performance and a smooth development experience.

### Backend Technologies

*   **Node.js & Express.js:** A powerful and efficient combination for building fast, scalable, and secure RESTful APIs. Node.js provides the JavaScript runtime, while Express.js offers a minimalist yet flexible framework for server-side logic.
*   **MongoDB & Mongoose:** A flexible NoSQL document database ideal for managing diverse data structures like resource metadata and user profiles. Mongoose simplifies interactions with MongoDB, providing robust schema validation and object modeling.
*   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Utilized for secure, stateless authentication and authorization, ensuring that user sessions are managed efficiently and securely without relying on server-side session storage.
*   **Bcrypt.js:** Employed for highly secure password hashing, protecting user credentials against common attacks like brute-force and rainbow table attacks.

### Frontend Technologies

*   **React & TypeScript:** React provides a declarative and component-based approach to building dynamic user interfaces, ensuring a highly responsive and interactive experience. TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability by introducing static type definitions, catching errors early in the development cycle.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development by allowing direct composition of styles in your markup. It promotes design consistency and results in highly optimized CSS bundles.
*   **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that delivers an exceptionally fast development experience, featuring instant server start-up and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for immediate feedback during development.
*   **Axios:** A robust, promise-based HTTP client used for making efficient and reliable API requests from the frontend to the backend, complete with powerful interceptor capabilities for global error handling and token management.
*   **React Router DOM:** Manages client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation within the single-page application.
*   **React Modal, React Markdown, React PDF:** Libraries specifically integrated to provide enhanced UI components and specialized content rendering capabilities for modals, Markdown, and PDF documents respectively.

## 4. Getting Started

Follow these straightforward steps to set up and run the Interview Prep Resource Hub on your local machine for development and testing.

### 4.1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

*   **Node.js (LTS version recommended):** This includes npm (Node Package Manager), essential for managing project dependencies. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **MongoDB:** The NoSQL database used by the application. You can download it from [mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or install it via your preferred package manager (e.g., `brew install mongodb-community` on macOS, `sudo apt install mongodb` on Ubuntu). **Ensure your MongoDB server is running** (typically by running `mongod` in your terminal).

### 4.2. Installation Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>/Interview3 # Navigate to the project root
    ```
    *(Note: If you received a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive, extract it and navigate into the `Interview3` directory.)*

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    cd .. # Return to the project root
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd .. # Return to the project root
    ```

### 4.3. Configuration

Both the backend and frontend utilize environment variables for sensitive information and configuration. You will find `.env.example` files in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories. Copy these to `.env` files in their respective locations and populate them with your specific values.

#### Backend (`./backend/.env`)

Create a file named `.env` in the `./backend` directory with the following content:

```dotenv
# Backend Environment Variables
PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/interviewhub # Your MongoDB connection string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key # A strong, random secret key for JWT
```

*   **`PORT`**: The port on which the backend server will listen. The default is `5001`.
*   **`MONGO_URI`**: Your MongoDB connection string. For a local MongoDB instance, `mongodb://localhost:27017/interviewhub` is a common default. Ensure `interviewhub` is the name of your database.
*   **`JWT_SECRET`**: A secret key used to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens. **For production environments, it is critically important to generate a unique, strong, and random string for this variable.**

#### Frontend (`./frontend/.env`)

Create a file named `.env` in the `./frontend` directory with the following content:

```dotenv
# Frontend Environment Variables
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api # This should match the proxy setting in vite.config.ts
```

*   **`VITE_API_BASE_URL`**: During development, this should typically be `/api`, as the Vite development server is configured to proxy requests from this path to your backend server.

### 4.4. Running the Application

1.  **Start MongoDB Server:**
    Ensure your MongoDB server is actively running. If it's not, initiate it from your terminal:
    ```bash
    mongod
    ```

2.  **Launch Backend and Frontend (Combined Script):**
    From the project root directory (`<your-repository-name>/Interview3`), execute the convenient combined development script:

    ```bash
    npm run dev:both
    ```

    This script, defined in `backend/package.json` and orchestrated via `backend/scripts/dev.sh`, will concurrently start:
    *   The backend Express server (default: `http://localhost:5001`)
    *   The frontend Vite development server (default: `http://localhost:5174`)

    You will observe output from both servers in your terminal, indicating successful startup.

3.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the frontend application URL:

    ```
    http://localhost:5174
    ```

    You are now ready to explore the Interview Prep Resource Hub, register new user accounts, log in, and utilize the comprehensive set of resources.

## 5. Project Structure

The project is thoughtfully organized into distinct `backend` and `frontend` directories, promoting a clear separation of concerns, modularity, and ease of navigation for developers.
